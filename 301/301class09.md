# Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
-  It is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   If
- A. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- B. It does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- Immutability
- Referential transparency

4. What is immutability?
- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

5. What is Referential transparency?
- Referential transparency is a fancy term that is attached to a computable expression. A piece of code is referentially transparent if we can safely replace that piece of code with the value it computes and vice-versa, anywhere where that piece is used, without changing the meaning or result of our program.

1. What is a module?
- Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application. 

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
- It imports
