## Component-Based Architecture

1. What is a Component?
* A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable
 set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation 
 and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

* A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, 
encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously
defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

* A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a 
contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software
component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.
