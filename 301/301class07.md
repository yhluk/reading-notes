# Read: Class 07 REST
## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
- He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- Machines don't have a universal noun

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
 
4. What does a GET do?
-  General purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

5. What does a POST do?
- To add something to another system

6. What does PUT do?
- To replace something in another system.

7. What does PATCH do?
- To do a partial update.
