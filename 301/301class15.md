 - ## What is OAuth

1. What is OAuth?
  - OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.

2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
  - When you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon.

3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
    1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
    2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
    3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
    4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
    5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
    6. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
    7. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
    8. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
    9. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
    10. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
    11. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
    12. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

4. What is OpenID?
  - OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans.

 - ## Authorization and Authentication flows

1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
 - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource or perform a specific action.

2. What is Authorization Code Flow?
 - Authorization Code Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication process where a client requests permission from a user to access a resource, the user grants permission, and the authorization server generates an authorization code that the client exchanges for an access token to access the resource.

3. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
 - Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an extension to the Authorization Code Flow that adds an additional layer of security. It prevents certain types of attacks by requiring the client to create and send a random value, called a code verifier, along with the authorization request. The authorization server then generates a code challenge based on the code verifier, which the client uses to exchange for an access token.

4. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
 - Implicit Flow with Form Post is another OAuth 2.0 authentication flow that is similar to Authorization Code Flow, but the access token is returned directly to the client in the URL fragment instead of exchanging an authorization code for it. The client must use a form post to send the access token to the server.

5. What is Client Credentials Flow?
- Client Credentials Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication process where a client application requests an access token from an authorization server using its own credentials (e.g., a client ID and client secret), rather than a user's credentials. This flow is typically used for machine-to-machine communication.

6. What is Device Authorization Flow?
- Device Authorization Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow that is designed for devices with limited input capabilities, such as smart TVs or gaming consoles. The flow involves the device displaying a code or URL to the user, who then uses a separate device to authorize the request.

7. What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
 - Resource Owner Password Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication process where a client application requests an access token from an authorization server using the username and password of the resource owner (i.e., the user). This flow should only be used when other flows are not available, as it requires the client to handle sensitive user credentials.
