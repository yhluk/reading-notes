## Class6 - JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
  + Bunch of description that belongs to one element.
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
  + The advantages of using object literals to create objects include convenience, 
flexibility in declaration, and less code during declaration
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
  + Objects represent “things” with characteristics, while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
  + If an object property name *is held in a variable*, then you **can't** use dot notation to access the value!!!
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?
  + Keyword `this` reffers to specific object inside of th code block. **This** enables you to use the same method 
definition for every object
