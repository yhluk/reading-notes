# **Creating hyperlinks**
## What is a hyperlink?
Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).

## Anatomy of a link
A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an *<a>* element and using the *href* attribute, also
known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

> <p>
>   I'm creating a link to
>   <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
> </p>

This gives us the following result:

I'm creating a link to the [Mozilla homepage](https://www.mozilla.org/).

Block level links
As mentioned before, almost any content can be made into a link, even block-level elements. 
If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the <a> element and reference the image file with the <img> element.
