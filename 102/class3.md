<h1>What is Git</h1>

By far, the most widely used modern version control system 
in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained
open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, 
the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control,
including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who 
have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software 
development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs 
(Integrated Development Environments).

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence 
Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single
place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-
popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), 
in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that 
can contain the full history of all changes.

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, 
security and flexibility in mind.
