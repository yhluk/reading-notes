The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:


- Control flow = order computer executes statements in a script
- function = block of code to perfrom particular task
- // Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
        function myFunction(p1, p2) {
            return p1 * p2;
        }
- parameters inside ()
- arguments are values recieved by function when invoked
- function stops when reaches a return statement
- functions can be used as variable values
- variables declared within fucntion are local to fucntion
- "+" is addtion
- "-" is subtract
- "*" is multiply
- "**" is exponentiation
- "/" division
- "%" modulus
- "++" increment
- "--" decrement
- expression = valid unit of code that resolves to a value
