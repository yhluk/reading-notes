What Is Markdown?
Markdown is a markup language used to create formatted text, typically for publishing on the internet. If you're not familiar, a markup language refers to a system that includes syntax elements that adjust the appearance of, but do not appear in, the final document.

For example, when you write "**bold text**" in a Markdown document, it will appear as "bold text".


Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).
