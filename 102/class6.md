you to manually reload a web page.

## Basicsâž¤

On page script

'<script type="text/javascript">  ...
</script>'

## Include external JS file

'<script src="filename.js"></script>'

## Functions

'function addNumbers(a, b) {
return a + b; ;
}
x = addNumbers(1, 2);'

## Output

'console.log(a);             // write to the browser console
document.write(a);          // write to the HTML
alert(a);                   // output in an alert box
confirm("Really?");         // yes/no dialog, returns true/false depending on user click
prompt("Your age?","0");    // input dialog. Second argument is the initial value'
