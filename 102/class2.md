What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

Code Editors

Code editors are interactive programs that make coding simple and easy to understand. By combining prompts, color coding, and explanation comments, coding is easier than ever. They also work with many coding languages so you don’t need to download tons of applications to experiment with other languages.

Here are some examples:

VSCode
GitHub’s Atom
NotePad++
